## Hi there ðŸ‘‹


**I am a dedicated and passionate Software Developer in progress, with a strong interest in backend development, clean code, and solving real-world problems through technology.

Currently, Iâ€™m working at Fara IT Fusion Ltd. as a WordPress Developer, where I build and maintain dynamic websites using tools like Elementor, WooCommerce, and ACF. While this role has helped shape my understanding of web development, my deeper ambition lies in backend engineering.

To pursue that goal, Iâ€™ve recently completed a course in Python Django, and Iâ€™m now focusing on Data Structures and Algorithms to sharpen my problem-solving skills.

I thrive in collaborative environments and am always eager to learn, grow, and contribute as part of a team. My mission is to continuously improve as a developer and use my skills to create solutions that matter.
